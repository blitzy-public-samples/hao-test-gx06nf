- Project management with user-specific ownership
- Hierarchical specification management with two levels
- RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations

The system will be built using:
- Python with Flask framework
- PostgreSQL database
- Google Cloud User Store for authentication
- RESTful API architecture

Key features within scope:
- User authentication and session management
- Project creation and management
- Specification creation, retrieval, and deletion
- Second-level item management within specifications
- Access control based on project ownership

Out of scope:
- Frontend implementation
- Third-party integrations beyond Google Cloud User Store
- Real-time collaboration features
- Version control of specifications

# 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

## 2.1 Product Perspective
The REST API backend system operates as a standalone service that interfaces with Google Cloud User Store for authentication and PostgreSQL for data persistence. It serves as the core backend infrastructure for managing specifications and projects, designed to be consumed by various frontend applications or services through its RESTful endpoints.

## 2.2 Product Functions
- User Authentication
  - Google Cloud User Store integration for secure login/logout
  - Session management and token validation
  
- Project Management
  - Creation and retrieval of user-owned projects
  - Project title and metadata management
  - Access control enforcement based on ownership

- Specification Management
  - Creation, retrieval, and deletion of specifications
  - Hierarchical organization with two-level structure
  - Ordered storage of specifications within projects
  - Unique identification system for specifications and items

- Second-level Item Management
  - Support for up to 10 bullet items per specification
  - Ordered storage and retrieval of items
  - Unique identification within parent specifications

## 2.3 User Characteristics
Primary users of the API system include:
- Software Developers: Technical users who will integrate and interact with the API endpoints
- System Administrators: IT professionals managing the backend infrastructure
- Project Owners: End users who will interact through a frontend application, requiring basic understanding of project and specification management

## 2.4 Constraints
- Technical Constraints
  - Must use Python with Flask framework
  - PostgreSQL as the only supported database
  - Google Cloud User Store as the authentication provider
  - RESTful architecture compliance requirements
  
- Business Constraints
  - Single user ownership model for projects
  - Maximum of 10 bullet items per specification
  - Specifications can only belong to one project
  - No direct specification updates (delete and recreate instead)

## 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Assumptions
  - Users have valid Google accounts for authentication
  - Stable network connectivity for API operations
  - PostgreSQL database is properly configured and accessible
  - Adequate storage capacity for specification and project data

- Dependencies
  - Google Cloud User Store availability and API stability
  - PostgreSQL database service availability
  - Python and Flask framework compatibility
  - Required Python packages and dependencies availability
